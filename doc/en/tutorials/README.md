# Tutorials

In this section, you can find the tutorials that can help you to put into practice Face SDK functions:

* [Face Detection and Tracking in a Video Stream](face_detection_and_tracking_in_a_video_stream.md)
* [Displaying Anthropometric Points and Head Rotation Angles](displaying_anthropometric_points_and_head_rotation_angles.md)
* [Estimating Age, Gender, and Emotions](estimating_age_gender_and_emotions.md)
* [Face Recognition in a Video Stream](face_recognition_in_a_video_stream.md)
* [Liveness Detection](liveness_detection.md)
* [Developing Apps for iOS](developing_apps_for_ios.md)
* [Detection and Recognition of Masked Faces](detection_and_recognition_of_masked_faces.md)

You can find the finished tutorial projects in the Face SDK distribution package: a path to a corresponding project is mentioned in the beginning of each tutorial. 

To create a project based on a tutorial from this section, you'll need: 

* **Face SDK**. In the section [Getting Started](../../../README.md#getting-started), you can find the instructions on how to download and unpack the distribution package. You can use the [version with a trial license](../../../README.md#face-sdk-trial).
* **Qt 5.11 or higher**. You can [download the Qt distribution package](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows.html) and [see the Qt installation instructions](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html#) at the [official Qt website](https://www.qt.io/).   

These tutorials expect that you have a reasonable understanding of the C++ programming language.
