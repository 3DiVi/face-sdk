# Guidelines for Cameras

## Camera Positioning and Shooting

To achive better tracking and detection results with Face SDK, please follow the recommendations below:

1. Requirements for lighting in the recognition zone:
   * illuminance level in the recognition area should be at least 200 Lux (only when the camera is located at a distance of no more than 3 m from a face), the optimal value is from 300 to 500 Lux
   * avoid back light whenever possible
   * light should be diffused. Avoid harsh shadows on a face
2. The camera should observe the face in a horizontal plane at an angle from 0 to 30 degrees, the optimum angle is from 0 to 15 degrees.
3. The camera should observe the face in a vertical plane at an angle from 0 to 20 degrees, the optimum angle is from 0 to 15 degrees.
4. It is recommended to place the camera at the face level.

## Recommended Cameras

We recommend to use *Axis P1365MK ii* or *P1367* (for longer distances).  
General recommendations for cameras are:  

1. 1080p (Full HD) resolution.
2. Frame rate of at least 10 FPS.
3. Suitable resolution and lens: the distance between the eyes of a face in the frame should be at least 30 pixels in the far field (for example, at the entrance) and at least 50 pixels in the near field (when a person already passes by the camera and leaves the frame).
4. Function of adjusting the exposure and shutter speed to prevent blurry frames of people passing by.
5. If a camera supports *WDR, Backlight compensation, Highlight compensation*, it is recommended to turn these functions off, otherwise the image can be blurry.
