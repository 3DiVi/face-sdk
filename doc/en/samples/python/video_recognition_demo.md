# video_recognition_demo 

The program demonstrates tracking, detection, and recognition of faces from the database.

## Software requirements

* Supported platforms: 
    * Windows 
    * Linux 
* Python 3.6 or higher. 
* The `setuptools` package must be installed before installing the demo.

## Installing the demo

Go to the `python_api` directory and run the command `pip3 install .`

## Running the demo 

1. You must first install the `face_sdk_3divi` module in Python.
2. A sample startup script is located in the `bin` directory: `python_demo_web_m_last_v30`. You can use this script as a basis and select the parameters you need. 
3. [For Windows only] Make sure that the path to the `bin` directory is added to the PATH system variable or run the script from this directory.

_**Note**: the demo was tested with OpenCV versions 4.1.0-4.1.2._
