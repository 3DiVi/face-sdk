# Samples

* Face SDK includes a set of programs that show how to work with C ++, Java and C# API.  
* The pre-built samples are located in the *bin* (C ++, C #) and *apk* (Java for Android) directories.  
* The source code is in the *examples* directory.

## Windows/Linux

To run the samples ([C++](cpp) and [C#](csharp)) on a PC, download and extract the Face SDK distribution package as described in [Getting Started](../../../README.md#getting-started). Before running a sample, make sure that you connected a camera (for example, a webcam) to your PC.

## Android (Java)

To run the samples for Android devices:

1. Download and extract the Face SDK distribution package as described in [Getting Started](../../../README.md#getting-started).
2. Copy the samples (`demo.apk` and/or `video_recognition.apk`) from the archive to your Android device.
3. Follow the instructions in [Android Demo](java/demo.md) and [Android Video Recognition](java/video_recognition_demo.md).
