# Samples

* Face SDK includes a set of programs that show how to work with C++, Java, C#, Python, Javascript API, [Unity](/doc/en/samples/unity/README.md).  
* The pre-built samples are located in the *bin* (C++, C#, Python, Unity) and *apk* (Java for Android) directories.  
* The source code is in the [examples](/examples) directory (C++, C#, Java, Python, Javascript).

## Windows/Linux

To run the samples ([C++](cpp), [C#](csharp), [Python](python)) on a PC, download and extract the Face SDK distribution package as described in [Getting Started](/README.md#getting-started). Before running a sample, make sure that you connected a camera (for example, a webcam) to your PC.

## Android (Java)

To run the samples for Android devices:

1. Download and extract the Face SDK distribution package as described in [Getting Started](/README.md#getting-started).
2. Copy the samples (`demo.apk` and/or `video_recognition.apk` and/or `telpo_3dliveness_video_recognition.apk`) from the archive to your Android device.
3. Follow the instructions in [Android Demo](java/demo.md), [Android Video Recognition](java/video_recognition_demo.md) or [Telpo Liveness Video Recognition](java/telpo_3dliveness_video_recognition.md).
